# billboard_hot_100_analysis
An analysis of Billboard Hot 100 entries and using machine learning to predict a song's peak position

This project uses a database of all Hot 100 entries since records began to find patterns in the data. Other data on the song is then extracted
using Spotify's API to perform machine learning on the data.
